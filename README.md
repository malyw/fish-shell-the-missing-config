# How to use

Just replace your [Fish Shell](http://fishshell.com/) config

(which usually is placed at `~/.config/fish/config.fish`)

with the `config.fish` file content provided in the repo.

Or just run:

```bash
cp ./config.fish ~/.config/fish/config.fish
```
 
# Profit
Makes Fish reusing your Environment Variables and Aliases provided for Bash Shell in a `~/.bash_profile` file
